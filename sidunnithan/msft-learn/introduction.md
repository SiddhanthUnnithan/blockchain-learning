- business process which allows trusting data and participants without central authority / database (de-centralized)
- blockchain = record-keeping and contract-enforcing tech that uses cryptography to disallow changes to previous history (immutable record)
- participants share workstreams and track changes on shared ledger
- why not central db?
    - advantage = easy to control access and consistency
    - trusted authority controlling access
    - all participants use the same data
    - participants need to trust that db is correct, need to trust that owner of db won't change history
    - gist: single db used by all participants with one trusted authority responsible for management
        - one participant may not be willing to take responsibility
        - trusted authority may illegitimately make changes to records
- why not distributed db?
    - each participant has their own copy
    - copies are multiplied and changes are synchronized
    - synchronization makes it complex (handle failures, conflicts)
- distributed ledger (i.e., blockchain)
    - history of transactions; each transaction affects final state
    - consortium network = blockchain network distributed among participants
    - each participant has visibility into every transaction which occurs on the network
    - consensus rules to ensure data is consistent
    - prevents participant or minority of participants from modifying history
How Blockhain works
- data distribution
    - each participant with blockchain node has copy of ledger for personal auditing and integration with their own systems
    - nodes can be shared between partners
    - nodes are connected using blockhain network
- changing state
    - transactions change state of the data
    - current state of ledger = transactions applied in order
    - transactions sent to blockchain transaction node
    - blockchain tech sends transaction throughout the network; each node gets copy of transaction
    - each node processes transaction; requires validation without using consensus mechanism
- trusting ledger data is consistent
    - trust is hard because data changes must occur across all nodes
    - what happens if node doesn't get transaction?
    - consensus mechanism used to validate and agree on data across all nodes
    - all decentralized nodes come to same state
    - order matters with transactions
    - double spend problem = using the same item to pay twice even after transfer of ownership
        - solved by consensus
    - consensus ensures correct order of transactions and integrity of blockchain
     - group of transactions validated as a block and entire network must agree if block should be included in blockchain
    - consensus algorithms: proof of work, proof of stake, proof of authority
    - consensus ensures distributed ledger comes to common state
- how to trust ledger is immutable
    - crypto hash used to create link between blocks, which allows order of transactions to be agreed upon
    - hash = maps data of arbitrary size to bit representation of fixed size; digital fingerprint analogy
    - blockchain uses hashes to detect if changes are made to blocks
        - blocks chained through hashes
    - subsequent block (transactions) hashes store previous block has; ensures immutable chain of transactions stored in order
    - if block is modified in chain, hash of later blocks is different
- trusted logic
    - DApp = decentralized application
    - Eth DApp called smart contracts; contains logic executed as part of the transaction
    - Solidity = programming language to program logic on Eth transactions
    - smart contracts deployed to blockchain and referenced by address
        - instance contains state and program logic
    - smart contracts are immutable; once deployed, logic can't change
Blockchain Types
    - public
        - decentralized with no single authority on network
        - all transactions are visible by any node on network
        - e.g., Bitcoin
        - public blockchains may charge cryptocurrency fee for validating transactions
    - private
        - semi-trusted networks
        - agreement between all participants about how blockchain will be used
        - consortium = private but authority is distributed
        - trust enforced by restricting only participants in validation
        - data can be kept private between participants
    - blockchain protocols
        - e.g., Bitcoin
            - primary fn: store Bitcoin value; value can be transferred from one to another
        - e.g., Ethereum
            - extends bitcoin allowing small programs to be written and value to be transferred
            - add logic and code instead of simple fixed value transfers
When to use blockchain
    - partners
        - multiple
        - avoid central auth
        - is data shared?
        - is there a workflow with several or all participants?
    - perf
        - low transaction throughput; rates can be low
        - business logic for transaction can affect perf
    - business logic
        - complex smart contract function on public blockchain requires more cryptocurrency
        - does logic need to be versioned? is it static without much change
    - trust
        - importance of trust and integrity
        - do transactions need to be ordered
        - do transactions need to be private
